                    <span>This crustless quiche made with eggs, spinach, and Muenster cheese is perfect to serve at any meal. With no heavy crust to make, this light-tasting quiche is ready in under an hour. Make it your own by adding leftover ham and substituting Cheddar, feta, or goat cheese for the Muenster. I serve this quick and easy quiche in the summer for brunch with a side of sausage links and a fresh fruit bowl !</span>
